# code-speed-handbook

This repository represents a field guide of many ways to speed up your code. Some are "traditional" algorithmic tweaks, some involve restructuring data to either let your cache help more or decrease the number of memory fetches, some involve parallelism, and some involve vectorization and hardware acceleration. This guide focuses mainly on Python-based examples, but the techniques should be transferrable to other languages

## Proposed Chapters:

- Basic Parallelism
- Advanced Parallelism
- Vectorization
- Dataflows
- Data Locality
- Cache Stuff
- Algorithmic Tricks
- Reorganizing Arrays
- Tail Recursion Elimination
- Taking advantage of your hardware
- Special instruction sets (AVX, SIMD stuff, etc.)
